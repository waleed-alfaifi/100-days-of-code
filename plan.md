# #100DaysOfCode - Plan

The idea behind this plan is to have a clear path to follow once I start.
But that does not mean I can't change it nor I will be able to follow it exactly as it is.

#### Some Rules:

- You will write the plan of each round just before you start that round. For example, plan of round 2 will be written when you are about to finish round 1, and so on.
- Plans are very flexible. It is okay to change plans as you go on with the challenge.

## Round 1 - 30 days

This round is all about CSS. I am not going to start building real projects in this round.

It will consist mainly of two parts:

- Building CSS components (e.g. cards, navbars).
- Building complete pages (with little or no functionality).

The most important rule here is: **CSS only is allowed. No frameworks.**
