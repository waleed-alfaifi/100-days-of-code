### Day 1: May 31, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Started on coding the first card using HTML and CSS only.

**Thoughts**: It feels good when you complete a task. I felt great about being able to manipulate CSS on my own. It is a less comfortable experience than a typical follow-along hand-holding tutorial, though.

### Day 2: June 1, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Completed the first card that I started yesterday.

**Thoughts**: I think I should'nt have used CSS grid for positioning elements inside the card. I felt like I complicated things unnecessarily just because I was very obssesed with making the card responsive.

### Day 3: June 2, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Finished challenge 1 (three cards) of the 30DaysOfCSS challenge.

**Thoughts**: The `box-sizing` property in CSS is well known and I have seen it a lot previously. Yet, I missed setting it to the value `border-box` for all elements to avoid increasing width when adding padding. This caused weird behavior since I was using the same width and height as the example I was copying but they didn't look the same. That was because of the extra padding :smile:.

### Day 4: June 3, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Started with challenge 2 of the 30DayOfCSS challenge.

**Thoughts**: Although this challenge is again about designing cards, it contains a challenging concern for me which is positioning images at the topmost or bottomost edge. I am struggling to get images not exceed their specified height while making sure everything is responsive. Guess I will have to work on that tomorrow.

### Day 5 - June 4, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Continued coding the card's image of challenge 2.
**Thoughts**: I found out how `background-image` can solve the problem of images exceeding the height specified for them. It comes with another problem which is the image gets cropped and therefore it does not look good.

### Day 6 - June 5, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Completed the second card of challenge 2.
**Thoughts**: I used `background-position` to get the image to not get cropped but then I increased the height of the card to accomodate the image's height. I want to start soon on developing complete pages. I think that would be better.

### Day 7 - June 7, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Started [this newbie challenge](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/huddle-landing-page-with-alternating-feature-blocks-5ca5f5981e82137ec91a5100) from frontendmentors website.
**Thoughts**: I missed yesterday but that was because I had just arrived from travel and I was busy arranging things. For today, I started doing one of the challenges of frontendmentors and hopefully I can finish it in less than five days.

### Day 8 - June 10, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Continued working on the mobile version of the challenge that started last time.
**Thoughts**: Starting with the mobile version is something I learned from a YouTube channel (forgot his name). He says that mobile version is by default responsive on larger screens, but not the other way around.

### Day 9 - June 11, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Continued working on the mobile version of the huddle landing page challenge.
**Thoughts**: I almost finished the mobile version today. I will start making it responsive for larger screens tomorrow.

### Day 10 - June 12, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Started making the huddle landing page responsive for larger screens.
**Thoughts**: Maybe starting with the mobile version wasn't the best decision. I had to make some workarounds to get the page looking like the design. I think it was too easy to make it for mobile first.

### Day 11 - June 13, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Still working on making the huddle landing page responsive for larger screens.
**Thoughts**: I am really struggling to align the footer's items like the design. Hopefully, I will be able to finish this challenge tomorrow.
