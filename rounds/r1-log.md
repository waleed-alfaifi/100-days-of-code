### Day 1: May 31, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Started on coding the first card using HTML and CSS only.

**Thoughts**: It feels good when you complete a task. I felt great about being able to manipulate CSS on my own. It is a less comfortable experience than a typical follow-along hand-holding tutorial, though.

### Day 2: June 1, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Completed the first card that I started yesterday.

**Thoughts**: I think I should'nt have used CSS grid for positioning elements inside the card. I felt like I complicated things unnecessarily just because I was very obssesed with making the card responsive.

### Day 3: June 2, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Finished challenge 1 (three cards) of the 30DaysOfCSS challenge.

**Thoughts**: The `box-sizing` property in CSS is well known and I have seen it a lot previously. Yet, I missed setting it to the value `border-box` for all elements to avoid increasing width when adding padding. This caused weird behavior since I was using the same width and height as the example I was copying but they didn't look the same. That was because of the extra padding :smile:.

### Day 4: June 3, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Started with challenge 2 of the 30DayOfCSS challenge.

**Thoughts**: Although this challenge is again about designing cards, it contains a challenging concern for me which is positioning images at the topmost or bottomost edge. I am struggling to get images not exceed their specified height while making sure everything is responsive. Guess I will have to work on that tomorrow.

---

### Day 5 - June 4, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Continued coding the card's image of challenge 2.
**Thoughts**: I found out how `background-image` can solve the problem of images exceeding the height specified for them. It comes with another problem which is the image gets cropped and therefore it does not look good.

---

### Day 6 - June 5, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Completed the second card of challenge 2.
**Thoughts**: I used `background-position` to get the image to not get cropped but then I increased the height of the card to accomodate the image's height. I want to start soon on developing complete pages. I think that would be better.

### Day 7 - June 7, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Started [this newbie challenge](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/huddle-landing-page-with-alternating-feature-blocks-5ca5f5981e82137ec91a5100) from frontendmentors website.
**Thoughts**: I missed yesterday but that was because I had just arrived from travel and I was busy arranging things. For today, I started doing one of the challenges of frontendmentors and hopefully I can finish it in less than five days.

### Day 8 - June 10, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Continued working on the mobile version of the challenge that started last time.
**Thoughts**: Starting with the mobile version is something I learned from a YouTube channel (forgot his name). He says that mobile version is by default responsive on larger screens, but not the other way around.

---

### Day 9 - June 11, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Continued working on the mobile version of the huddle landing page challenge.
**Thoughts**: I almost finished the mobile version today. I will start making it responsive for larger screens tomorrow.

---

### Day 10 - June 12, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Started making the huddle landing page responsive for larger screens.
**Thoughts**: Maybe starting with the mobile version wasn't the best decision. I had to make some workarounds to get the page looking like the design. I think it was too easy to make it for mobile first.

### Day 11 - June 13, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Still working on making the huddle landing page responsive for larger screens.
**Thoughts**: I am really struggling to align the footer's items like the design. Hopefully, I will be able to finish this challenge tomorrow.

### Day 12 - June 14, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Finished the Huddle landing page.

**Thoughts**: Sometimes I use some CSS properties just because they work and not because I fully understand them :smile:.

### Day 13 - June 15, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Fixed some issues regarding browser compatiblity of the Huddle landing page.

**Thoughts**: Browsers render SVGs differently for some reason.

### Day 14 - June 16, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Continued fixing the issues regarding browser compatiblity of the Huddle landing page.

**Thoughts**: I solved the problem using a flex-basis on the parent div of the SVG image. I think images should always have a parent container that controls their size.

### Day 15 - June 17, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Started a new challenge of the frontend mentors challenges called url-shortening-api landing page.

**Thoughts**: I am back to React finally :smile:. I will be doing the CSS (layout) part the next weeks (until the end of the 30DayOfCSS challenge) then start with the actual functionalities. Glad to be able to code basic landing pages, though I still need to improve my design skills.

---

### Day 16 - June 18, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Added the HTML structure of the url-shortening-api landing page.

**Thoughts**: It's helpful to lay out the HTML code first before any CSS. This way, you understand your page styles structure before writing any of them. Not that I don't make changes to the HTML code later on, though.

---

### Day 17 - June 19, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Started coding the navbar part of the url-shortening-api landing page.

**Thoughts**: I started with the desktop design this time, as I think it makes more sense. I think the navbar is looking good already but I will probably have to change it later.

### Day 18 - June 20, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Now trying to make the showcase section.

**Thoughts**: I am really struggling to get the showcase's image to move to the right of the page. I will try to get it tomorrow.

**Link(s) to work**: _No Link_

---

### Day 19 - June 22, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Still completing the showcase section.

**Thoughts**: The image gets cropped when I try to push it to the right because of the container. This is really frustrating.

**Link(s) to work**: _No Link_

---

### Day 20 - June 23, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Finished the showcase section.

**Thoughts**: I decided to leave the showcase's image as is. Well, it looks okay anyway :sweat_smile:.

**Link(s) to work**: _No Link_

### Day 21 - June 24, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Worked on the shorten it section.

**Thoughts**: Not in my best days but trying to complete the challenge for as long as I can.

**Link(s) to work**: _No Link_

---

### Day 22 - June 25, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Completed the shorten it section.

**Thoughts**: Now I need to work on the shortened urls containers. I will probably have to change the shorten it section a little bit.

**Link(s) to work**: _No Link_


---

### Day 23 - June 28, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Finished a static version of the shortened urls containers.

**Thoughts**: As I thought, I had to rearrange the markup a little bit to be able to finish the shortened urls section.

### Day 24 - July 1, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Started working on the features section.

**Thoughts**: It is unfortunate that I am skipping some days. But that's because I come back from work too tired to write a single code. I was able to do it today, thankfully.

**Link(s) to work**: _No Link_

---

### Day 25 - July 2, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Continued working on the features section.

**Thoughts**: I was barely able to complete my 1-hour of coding today. Thankful to my ability to copy designs using pure CSS.
