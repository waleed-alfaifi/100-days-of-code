### Day 1: May 31, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Started on coding the first card using HTML and CSS only.

**Thoughts**: It feels good when you complete a task. I felt great about being able to manipulate CSS on my own. It is a less comfortable experience than a typical follow-along hand-holding tutorial, though.

### Day 2: June 1, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Completed the first card that I started yesterday.

**Thoughts**: I think I should'nt have used CSS grid for positioning elements inside the card. I felt like I complicated things unnecessarily just because I was very obssesed with making the card responsive.
