### Day 1: May 31, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Started on coding the first card using HTML and CSS only.

**Thoughts**: It feels good when you complete a task. I felt great about being able to manipulate CSS on my own. It is a less comfortable experience than a typical follow-along hand-holding tutorial, though.

### Day 2: June 1, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Completed the first card that I started yesterday.

**Thoughts**: I think I should'nt have used CSS grid for positioning elements inside the card. I felt like I complicated things unnecessarily just because I was very obssesed with making the card responsive.

### Day 3: June 2, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Finished challenge 1 (three cards) of the 30DaysOfCSS challenge.

**Thoughts**: The `box-sizing` property in CSS is well known and I have seen it a lot previously. Yet, I missed setting it to the value `border-box` for all elements to avoid increasing width when adding padding. This caused weird behavior since I was using the same width and height as the example I was copying but they didn't look the same. That was because of the extra padding :smile:.
